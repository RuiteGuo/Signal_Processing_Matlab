# Signal_Processing_Matlab
This repository contains matlab file I wrote when I was taking a signal processing course.
These matlab files were implemented with algorithm that deals with following staff:
1. using signal processing principles to adjust the tune of a song and base of a song
2. using fourier transform to deal with radio signal
3. implementing Park-McClean filter algorithm that cleans up additional noise in a radio file to obtain pure radio sounds
4. implementing 2D signal processing filter to deal with pictures
5. implementing least significant bit algorithm to implant watermark and text messages into a picture
